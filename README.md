## Challenges Faced and Resolutions:
Throughout the development of our JioSaavn Clone Website Project, our team encountered various challenges and obstacles. Here, we document some of the major issues we faced and the solutions we implemented:
1. **Challenge 1 - Cross-browser Compatibility:**
   - Ensuring that our website looked and functioned consistently across different web browsers posed a significant challenge.
   - **Resolution:** We performed rigorous testing and debugging across various browsers, identifying and rectifying CSS and JavaScript compatibility issues.
   - This involved adjusting styles and optimizing code to achieve a cohesive user experience.
2. **Challenge 2 - Responsive Design:**
   - Creating a responsive design that adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices required careful planning and execution.
   - **Resolution:** We adopted a desktop-first design approach and utilized CSS media queries extensively.
   - Regular testing on various devices allowed us to fine-tune the responsiveness of our website.
3. **Challenge 3 - Team Collaboration and Version Control:**
   - Coordinating tasks among team members and ensuring smooth version control throughout the project proved to be a challenge.
   - **Resolution:** We implemented a version control system (e.g., Git and GitHub) and established clear merging processes.
   - Regular team meetings and communication channels, such as Slack and zoom/ google meet, facilitated collaboration and issue tracking.
     
*By acknowledging these challenges and sharing our solutions, we hope to provide insights into our development process and demonstrate our team's problem-solving abilities. Overcoming these obstacles has contributed to the successful completion of the JioSaavn Clone Website Project.*
